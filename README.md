The MDP_files folder contains the mdp files used for energy minimization, equilibration, and production simulations.  
The Martinize folder contains the ions.mdp file used for the genion step during initial structure preparation, the dat file used to specify peptide coordinates, and template topology files.  
The basic itp files were downloaded from the official Martini website (https://cgmartini.nl/docs/downloads/force-field-parameters/martini3/particle-definitions.html).  
The itp files for DOPG and DOPE were obtained from the Supporting Information of the paper by Vaiwala and Ayappa (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00471).  
All commands used are listed in the “Commands”.  
The create_index.py was downloaded from the official Martini 3 lipidomics tutorial available at: https://github.com/martincalvelo/MARTINI-CG-TUTORIALS.git.
